Awesome is a highly configurable, tiling window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.  Awesome is a perfect "first" tiling window manager for those who want to try out tiling, but the extreme customization that you can achieve with awesome makes it a power user's dream.  Awesome is configured with Lua.

# Features

* Simple enough for beginner's but flexible enough for the power user.
* Extremely customizable, maybe more so than any other window manager.
* Configured in Lua.
* A documented API to configure and define the behavior of your window manager.

# Installation

* sudo pacman -S awesome dmenu thunar firefox terminator
* yay -S i3lock-fancy-git 

# Additional tools for Customizing it.

* sudo pacman -S lxappearance picom nitrogen

# My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (alacritty is the terminal but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | opens run launcher (dmenu is the run launcher but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + c` | closes window with focus |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | restarts awesome |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | quits awesome |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + j` | switches focus between windows in the stack, going down |
| `MODKEY + k` | switches focus between windows in the stack, going up |
| `MODKEY + h` | switches focus between windows in the stack, going left |
