Awesome is a highly configurable, tiling window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.  Awesome is a perfect "first" tiling window manager for those who want to try out tiling, but the extreme customization that you can achieve with awesome makes it a power user's dream.  Awesome is configured with Lua.

# Features

* Simple enough for beginner's but flexible enough for the power user.
* Extremely customizable, maybe more so than any other window manager.
* Configured in Lua.
* A documented API to configure and define the behavior of your window manager.

# Installation

```bash
sudo pacman -S awesome dmenu rofi thunar firefox alacritty
```

```bash
paru -S i3lock-fancy-git picom-ibhagwan-git
```
# Additional tools for Customizing it.

```bash
sudo pacman -S lxappearance nitrogen
```
* For Fonts Im using Terminus
```bash
sudo pacman -S terminus-font 
```

```bash
paru -S consolas-font
```

# My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (Alarcritty is the terminal but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + x` | opens run launcher (rofi (random) is the run launcher but can be easily changed) |
